# Form Validation 2
<p>Create and validate a form in PHP, validating with regular expressions on the server side.</p>
<p><a href="http://lianxiao.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/xiaoyu/FormValidation2/index.php">See it</a></p>
There has:
<ul>
  <li>A css file which contains all of my style code</li>
  <li>A single .PHP file</li>
</ul>

<p>This survey ask the user the following questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Their First name and last name (two separate fields). They must enter in at least two characters for each field.</li>
    <li>Their age in a text field. This must be a number.</li>
    <li>Their street address.  Must have a number plus a street name.</li>
    <li>Their postal code. – Postal Codes are in the format ‘A1A 1A1’, where A is a letter and 1 is a digit, with a space separating the third and fourth characters.</li>
    <li>Their province from a drop down list.</li>
</ul>
<p>All fields should be checked for errors upon form submission.  If there are errors, an error message should be displayed in words. E.g., “Age must be a number between…”. Place your error message by the question that generated the error.</p>
<p>Once the form has been submitted successfully (with no errors), display all of the user information below the form. If there are still errors, do not display this information.
